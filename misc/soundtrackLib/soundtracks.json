		"notes": "Denpa Onna's music is, overall, quite standard I would say. That is not to say it's not worth having in my collection. Ryuuko's theme is notable - a simple, waltz-like 'ditzy' piano piece in three-quarters time is a perfect fit for her character. Maekawa's theme embodies her being somewhat of a troublesome cosplayer through a mildly frantic-sounding symphonic march. Unfortunately, many of the sounds are synthetic; however, the blending of their sounds produces an acceptable quality, at least to me.",

Mr. Matsuda's writing ability for strings, especially quartets, is exceptional. \n\nThe prominent themes throughtout the anime are represented mainly through a string quartet, written in very authentic-sounding 'classical' style. This was the first time I had heard 'classical' music written in today's time that resembled Classical period music so well. \n\nadditionally, for the more modern pieces, the use of woodwinds, orchestra, and piano are blended to create very rich harmonies and exciting melodies. There is one piece, which feels like a mini piano concerto, that's a bit over 9 minutes. much impressed.",

I think it sounds a bit like some of the Beatles' music, which is not surprising since if I recall correctly Mr. Kosaki is a Beatles fan.",

There are many tracks I would consider to be 'pure' BGM, in that they're there mostly for effect, pretty short, and are pretty meaningless without some visual context.

A good mix of military-ish music, with arrangements of military music from around the world (i.e. the British Grenadiers march, the US Field Artillery march, etc.), typical battle music, fanfare-ish/triumphal music, and some regular light music you'd normally hear in a 'slice-of-life' anime. There are some good, easy-to-recognize leitmotifs throughout the soundtrack which can be heard in various forms depending on the context (sometimes it gets a bit repetitive though). \n\nOne small gripe I have though is maybe the mixing/personnel choices for the music. While it's great they have real musicians and instruments performing, I feel that sometimes the trumpets come off a bit too strong and don't blend quite well with the other instruments.",

Along with generally creating more modern compositions accompanying rap (usually done by Lotus Juice, I think), his orchestral writing I would say is very much on par with film scores done by the top names in the industry, i.e. Joe Hisaishi. \n\nThere are some great themes that get developed in this soundtrack - one of my favorites is Togame's theme. There are a few pieces that are rock and/or electronic based, which adds more flavor to the soundtrack. All in all, there's a great mix of styles and really amazing themes that make this album great for standalone listening. \n\nAlso, there's some interesting instrumentation to look out for, such as the erhu and a Southeast Asian percussion instrument called 'angklung' (it's quite prominent in Nanami's theme).",

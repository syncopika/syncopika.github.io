			<h4><b><a href='https://syncopika.github.io/piano_roll_browser/'> piano roll browser </a></b></h4>
			<p> This project is definitely one of my favorites and one of the most interesting. It lets you compose music in the browser! It's made of mostly vanilla JS, HTML and CSS and leverages the Web Audio API and a bit of jQuery. </p>
			<p> I also created an incomplete companion application called <a href='https://syncopika.github.io/soundmaker/'><b> soundmaker </b></a> to create custom instruments that you could import into the piano roll.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h4><b><a href='https://syncopika.github.io/funSketch/'> funSketch </a></b></h4>
			<p> This is a web application for drawing and animating. There are different kinds of image filters and brushes to use, as well as onion-skin and layering. I relied on React for this project.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h4><b><a href='https://github.com/syncopika/gifCatch_desktop-Windows-'> gifCatch </a></b></h4>
			<p> gifCatch is a Windows application that allows you to capture part (or all) of your screen for a period of time to create a gif animation. You can also feed it .bmp images to create a gif from and there are image filter options!</p>
			<p>This is one of my first 'serious' projects and has been very fun to work on. It's built with C++ and the Win32 API (for the GUI as well so the appearance certainly isn't the greatest). It's also been pretty useful as I've used it quite a bit to generate screen capture gifs of my projects :) </p>
			<br>
			
			<h4><b><a href='https://syncopika.github.io/music-score-viewer/'> music score viewer </a></b></h4>
			<p>Nothing super special but this is a tool that allows you to sync music score page turning (a pdf score) with audio with some manual intervention in the form of JSON. It utilizes pdf.js and a bit of React (for routing). I use it to showcase some of my music composition/arrangement work.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h4><b><a href='https://syncopika.github.io/threejs-projects/'> threejs projects </a></b></h4>
			<p> This is a collection of small 3d projects I've created using three.js and models I made in Blender. For each project I try to implement an idea that could be useful on its own as well as tackle some new kind of 3d graphics/threejs/algorithm-related problem I haven't yet tried.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h4><b><a href='https://syncopika.github.io/trip-planner/'> trip-planner </a></b></h4>
			<p> This is an idea I had for a trip planner. It has an interactive map in which the user can plot markers for trip destinations and provide extra information about each destination (notes, pictures, dates). It's currently in a pretty basic state. For this project I used Vue, Typescript and the MapBox API. </p>

                    <p> This project lets you compose music in the browser! I also created an incomplete companion application called <span class='projectTitle'><a href='https://syncopika.github.io/soundmaker/'> soundmaker </a></span> to create custom instruments that you could import into the piano roll.</p>

                    <p> This is an experimental idea I had for a trip planner. It has an interactive map in which the user can plot markers for trip destinations and provide extra information about each destination (notes, pictures, dates). </p>

                    <p> This is a collection of small 3d projects with models I made in Blender. For each project I try to implement an idea that could be useful on its own as well as explore 3d graphics/threejs/algorithm-related ideas/concepts.</p>

                    <p> gifCatch is a Windows application that allows you to capture part (or all) of your screen for a period of time or feed it a series of .bmp images to create a .gif. It also has image filter options!</p>
                    <p> It's been pretty useful as I've used it quite a bit to generate screen capture gifs of my projects :) </p>

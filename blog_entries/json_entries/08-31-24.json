I spent many many hours playing it :).\n</p><p>I recently extracted some assets (namely some armor and weapons), converted them to .obj files with the helpful <a href='https://github.com/niftools/nifskope'>nifskope</a> program and imported them into Blender! Then I was able to arrange the pieces in various poses.\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/morrowind_armor/royal_guard.png\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/morrowind_armor/high_ordinator.png\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/morrowind_armor/glass_armor.png\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/morrowind_armor/31-08-2024_173726.gif\" alt=\"\"><br /><br /><p>I also exported them as .gltf files and was able to do funny stuff like this using my <a href='https://syncopika.github.io/livery/'>livery web app</a>:\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/morrowind_armor/lol-ordinator.png\" alt=\"\"><br /><br /><p>I suppose a good next step would be to make an armature in Blender with which to bind the armor to for more easier posing!\n</p>"

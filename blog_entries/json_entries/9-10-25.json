Qixing and saw the fumaroles at Xiaoyoukeng!), Tamsui, Beitou, Yilan (Jiaoxi) and Hsinchu.\n</p><p>Some airplane food pics:\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250827_095119626.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250827_185515436.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250904_162847776.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250904_164243104.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250904_165240666.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250904_170436019.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250905_005918202.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250905_011305244.webp\" alt=\"\"><br /><h3>Yangmingshan (\u967d\u660e\u5c71)\n</h3><p>The peak was only 1120 meters but the hike was pretty steep with very narrow steps at some parts so I didn't find it very easy.

I didn't go to any of them though. Maybe another time! :)\n</p><p>here's a random view near a bus station\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250830_034143502.webp\" alt=\"\"><br /><p>I did find a PX Mart which was neat (and my first time I think checking out a local supermarket in Taiwan!).\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250830_025804844.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250830_025844202.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250830_025849205.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250830_025859483.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250830_030126289.webp\" alt=\"\"><br /><p>I had some seafood zhou (\u6d77\u9bae\u7ca5) in Yilan!

I'm no expert though on mifen so I have no idea if this was good quality or not lol.\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250831_022802783.webp\" alt=\"\"><p>I thought this one was ok overall - I'm not sure what the pink sauce is but iirc it was salty/savory? There was some bean sprouts, some green onions and some chicken slices.\n</p><p>It was also kinda early in the day so maybe there weren't too many options yet but I felt like I had some difficulty finding places selling cooked mifen (specifically stir-fried mifen (\u7092\u7c73\u7c89)). I guess I need to go back!\n</p><h3>Keelung (\u57fa\u9686)\n</h3><p>Went to Keelung again to get my beloved pineapple cakes from Lee Hu Bakery but also visited some parts that I hadn't really explored before.\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250902_010918538.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250902_012559208.webp\" alt=\"\"><br /><h3>Taipei (\u53f0\u5317)\n</h3><p>Got some shaobing youtiao (\u71d2\u9905\u6cb9\u689d) and cold light charcoal-flavored doujiang (\u8c46\u6f3f) from Shijie Soy Milk King (\u4e16\u754c\u8c46\u6f3f\u5927\u738b)! Really good and the charcoal flavoring wasn't too heavy :thumbs-up:\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250827_233344386.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250827_233440325.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250827_233805826.webp\" alt=\"\"><br /><p>I visited a 24-hr Carrefour near Ximending! It was pretty cool - they had coffee-flavored (relatively rare I think - every 7-11 and Family Mart I went to did not have coffee-flavored Doritos) and coriander-flavored Doritos! Here's a pic of my snack haul:\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250902_091234572.webp\" alt=\"\"><p>They also had a lot of prepared fruit for sale, including sugar apple. I got to try sugar apple for the first time! Very creamy and sweet but a bit annoying to eat because of all the seeds.\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250903_235459961.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250902_091309043.webp\" alt=\"\"><br /><p>I visited Dongmen Market (\u6771\u9580\u5e02). Pretty cool and large market with loads of vendors selling fresh produce, fish and meat, as well as some cooked food.\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250828_001944750.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250828_002345820.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250828_002350461.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250828_002415765.webp\" alt=\"\"><br /><p>I also went to Dihua Street a bit north of Taipei Main Station. There are lots of vendors selling dried fruits, snacks and Chinese medicinal ingredients.\n</p><p>I had the honor of meeting a very friendly cat there :)\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250903_010016748.webp\" alt=\"\"><p>There's also a large indoor market called \u6c38\u6a02\u5e02\u5834 (Yong Le Market) with various vendors selling produce, fish, meat, food and fabrics.\n</p><p>In particular, there's a famous sticky rice (\u6cb9\u98ef) vendor that I got sticky rice from. It was really good and had lots of mushrooms.\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250903_020459804.webp\" alt=\"\"><br /><br /><p>and of course pineapple cakes! \u9cf3\u68a8\u9165! again! :D I love Taiwanese pineapple cakes lol. \n</p><p>I got the ones from Lee Hu (\u674e\u9d60) in Keelung that my grandmother would always bring back from Taiwan (I love that the wrapper for their pineapple cakes hasn't changed) and I also visited their branch store in Taipei, which I only found out about recently and whose pineapple cakes are basically the same as the Keelung one lol (their wrapper is a bit different and made of wax(?) paper).\n</p><p>I also tried pineapple cakes from 3 new stores: Sunny Hills (just their outlet in Taipei 101 though - I need to visit their main store next time!), Leechi in Taipei (\u53f0\u5317\u7281\u8a18) and Len Jen (\u9023\u73cd) in Keelung (near Lee Hu).\n</p><p>I thought they were all really good lol. Sunny Hills also sells apple cakes, which is a great idea. Leechi sells some interesting pineapple cakes that contain either cranberry or fig.\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/taiwan trip 2025/PXL_20250909_211324902.webp\" alt=\"\">"

    "content": "<p>I went to the airshow at Andrews Air Force Base this past Saturday for the first time in a long time (I think I last went at least 10 years ago now!). \n</p><p>It was unfortunately disappointing and not well organized, at least transportation-wise (and heard many others complain as well about the logistics). \n</p><p>The static displays were quite boring compared to previous times I had been there and the performances were boring as well (imo), with only one military fighter demo (F-18 Super Hornet), which I missed because the busing from Northwest Stadium to the base was incredibly slow for some reason (not to mention there were a lot of people but things still moved seemingly unnecessarily slowly). There was supposed to be a F-35A demo that I was excited about but I found out later that it got cancelled for all three days of the airshow :(. The Thunderbirds were fine as usual :).\n</p><p>The staff and everyone involved were awesome though and I think were trying their best. Just not sure why things were so slow? Leaving the base via the buses was also a nightmare :(. \n</p><p>Anyway, at least the weather was pretty nice for an airshow and I got to see it once again and got my fill of jet noise. But I probably won't go back unless the static displays and performances improve lol. \n</p><p>Some pics and vids:\n</p><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/airshow 2025/PXL_20250913_163127644.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/airshow 2025/PXL_20250913_163226694.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/airshow 2025/PXL_20250913_163650535.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/airshow 2025/PXL_20250913_163902511.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/airshow 2025/PXL_20250913_164148101.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/airshow 2025/PXL_20250913_164243643.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/airshow 2025/PXL_20250913_173336677.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/airshow 2025/PXL_20250913_174426769.webp\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"\" src=\"blog_entries/images/airshow 2025/PXL_20250913_193807594.webp\" alt=\"\"><br /><br /><video width=\"250px\" controls> <source src=\"blog_entries/images/airshow 2025/PXL_20250913_192443371.TS.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> </video><video width=\"250px\" controls> <source src=\"blog_entries/images/airshow 2025/PXL_20250913_192554961.TS.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> </video><video width=\"250px\" controls> <source src=\"blog_entries/images/airshow 2025/PXL_20250913_192646292.TS.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> </video><video width=\"250px\" controls> <source src=\"blog_entries/images/airshow 2025/PXL_20250913_192719473.TS.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> </video>"

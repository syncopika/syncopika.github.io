about this blog

--p
Each blog post starts off as a .txt file with a basic format shown below.

--tags

--h2

--p

So I have some basic tags representing metadata (such as date, tags) and a content flag to signal the start of the content of the post.
--p
Then for the content I have flags like --p, which converts the following line below it into a corresponding HTML element, which in this case is a paragraph element.
--p
I made a really rudimentary <a href="https://github.com/syncopika/syncopika.github.io/blob/master/blog_entries/convert_txt.py"><b>parser</b></a> in Python to convert the .txt file into JSON, which gets consumed by Vue and presented in HTML since I converted my text into strings containing HTML elements.

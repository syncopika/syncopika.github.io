I went to the airshow at Andrews Air Force Base this past Saturday for the first time in a long time (I think I last went at least 10 years ago now!). 

--p
It was unfortunately disappointing and not well organized, at least transportation-wise (and heard many others complain as well about the logistics). 

--p
The static displays were quite boring compared to previous times I had been there and the performances were boring as well (imo), with only one military fighter demo (F-18 Super Hornet), which I missed because the busing from Northwest Stadium to the base was incredibly slow for some reason (not to mention there were a lot of people but things still moved seemingly unnecessarily slowly). There was supposed to be a F-35A demo that I was excited about but I found out later that it got cancelled for all three days of the airshow :(. The Thunderbirds were fine as usual :).

--p
The staff and everyone involved were awesome though and I think were trying their best. Just not sure why things were so slow? Leaving the base via the buses was also a nightmare :(. 

--p
Anyway, at least the weather was pretty nice for an airshow and I got to see it once again and got my fill of jet noise. But I probably won't go back unless the static displays and performances improve lol.

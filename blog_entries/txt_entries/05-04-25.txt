I went to Japan from 4/5 - 4/15!

--p
I stayed in Tokyo (Kamata) for 4 days, then went to Kyoto for 3 days, and then back to Tokyo (near Tokyo Station)! I unfortunately got sick in Kyoto :(. But overall it was pretty great!
The people and the sights were awesome! The crowded trains terrify me though, although I suppose it is a quintessential experience when in Tokyo 😆.
Fortunately the weather was also very cooperative for most of the trip. I flew ANA (economy) from IAD <-> HND.

--p
Here's some pics!

airplane food :D it was all pretty good (imo)!

had some really good oyakodon at a place near Yasukuni Shrine. portion size was also very good. 
I remember trying oyakodon once in Taipei Main Station and the bowl was actually really shallow so I kinda felt cheated :/. 
It was totally different here and so much better.

pretty cherry blossoms along the river near Edogawabashi Station.
I just decided to check it out on a whim since it was on the way I was going and that turned out to be a good decision :D.

I also went to Bondy to try their curry (mild spice level - 中辛). I thought it was spicier than I anticipated (many reviews I read said it wouldn't be lol), but very good! however I didn't really like the pickles on the side and the red fruit-looking thing among the pickles was kinda hard and had seeds I think? it was weird imo lol.
unfortunately I don't remember enough to describe the flavor better and tbh I went at a time I wasn't really hungry (like a bit before 3pm) but it was certainly different from the usual Japanese curry iirc. 
luckily I did not have to wait in line at all (but when I left there was a line).
--p
there are some interesting condiment options on the table that you can freely add as well like raisins with shredded coconut lol. and the 3 potatoes with butter was pretty cool.

<b>Yokohama Chinatown</b>
honestly kinda boring compared to NYC's Chinatowns imo :/. 
but glad I went and defintiely worth trying Japanese shumai to get a sense of the difference from Cantonese dim sum shumai.

had some really good karaage at a teishoku place called Idoya (井戸) in Kamata. 
it was also my first time trying karaage so I have nothing else to compare it to lol but it was crispy, juicy and the amount of food was generous, especially for the price!
this set was less than ¥1000 (even including the small dish of spinach (ほうれん草) with katsuobushi on top that was a la carte and only ¥180)!

Kyoto 京都
--p
tried some soba at supposedly Kyoto's oldest soba restaurant, Honke Owariya (本家尾張屋). 
again, it was my first time trying soba so I have nothing else to compare to but overall very good! and there was what I think was freshly grated wasabi, which was pretty cool.
my tempura I think could've been a bit crispier though iirc.

Kyoto Station is hugeeeeeee. I found it a bit difficult to get from the north side of the station to the south side of the station (where my hotel was) lol.

snack haul from Family Mart

the bread varieties from the convenience stores there are awesome and delicious! the bread quality is soft and fluffy, like the bread you can find in Asian bakeries in the US.

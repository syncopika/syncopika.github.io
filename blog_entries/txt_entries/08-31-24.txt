Morrowind is one of my most favorite video games of all time. I spent many many hours playing it :).

I recently extracted some assets (namely some armor and weapons), converted them to .obj files with the helpful <a href='https://github.com/niftools/nifskope'>nifskope</a> program and imported them into Blender! Then I was able to arrange the pieces in various poses.

I also exported them as .gltf files and was able to do funny stuff like this using my <a href='https://syncopika.github.io/livery/'>livery web app</a>:

I suppose a good next step would be to make an armature in Blender with which to bind the armor to for more easier posing!

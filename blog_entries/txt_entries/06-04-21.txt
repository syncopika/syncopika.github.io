I went to Lake Tahoe for a few days at the end of May for a cousin's wedding. The weather was perfect the whole time! :O. Not very fun traveling with COVID-19 still being a thing but the trip was relatively painless. Got to see some nice cars and aircraft to boot :D.

the pine trees (and pinecones) at Lake Tahoe are much bigger than what you'd see in Maryland lol

some future work I'd like to do

--p
- have my flashcards Android app to also fetch Japanese flashcard data asynchronously from an online source
- improve my 3d cat model (featured in my threejs-projects cat demo) + more animations
- make a new 3d demo using speech recognition API
- improve my 3d music visualizer recording functionality to properly capture high resolution (using an offscreen canvas?)
- improve funSketch (clean things up, see if I can delete code, use context for sharing data between components more easily?)
- understand and implement Poisson image editing
